Data Set:
I used the Global Terrorism Database for my data set.
I pared down the data set to remove incidents with a month or day value of 0,
I removed a fair number of the collumns that I would not be using, in order to 
make the size of the file more managable. I also removed entries that had
unknown cities, or no geographical information.
